| **Chatbot with JSON** | In the supermarket surveillance video, the tech section shows a dynamic scene with five people interacting, indicated by their movements and slight collisions. Some appear to be enjoying beverages, as two bottles are visible. A bicycle suggests one visitor arrived in an unusual way. Elsewhere, three people examine electronic products—two discussing a device while the third waits. These interactions highlight consumer interest and create a vibrant atmosphere. |
| **Chatbot without YOLO** | It was a sunny day at the supermarket, and the tech area was full of life. A curious young man approached a shelf of the latest phones as a friendly vendor got ready to explain their features. In the background, a group of friends laughed while debating which laptop to buy. One tested a VR headset while another admired a phone. A child suddenly ran into a shopper admiring a TV, prompting smiles. The setting was full of excitement and connection. |
| **Chatbot with YOLO** | On a sunny day, the supermarket buzzes with eager shoppers. A group of friends jokes as they head to the tech store. A mother pushes a cart while her child excitedly points at a toy display. In the back, teens stop in awe at a new gadget. The lively ambiance is filled with laughter and chatter. A cart halts abruptly, causing a brief tense moment, quickly resolved with a smile. The mall continues as a vibrant hub of discovery and interaction. |
| **Human** | The video appears to be from a supermarket security camera in the tech aisle. On the right, boxes with charger cables are visible; on the left, a shelf of digital money cards. More people are seen compared to the previous video—perhaps due to the time or day. Several people walk by with carts while three approach the camera to view items in the aisle. |
